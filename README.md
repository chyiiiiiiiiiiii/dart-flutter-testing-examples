## Introduction

This Flutter project serves as a comprehensive example for implementing and managing different types of tests. It includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Validate the functionality of individual classes, methods, or functions.
- **Widget Tests**: Test the UI components in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure that all parts of the app work together seamlessly.

## Features

- Modular architecture facilitating easy testing.
- Comprehensive test suites covering various components.
- Responsive UI built with Flutter's Material Design.
- Example quiz functionality to demonstrate state management and user interactions.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-testing-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd flutter-testing-project
   ```

3. **Fetch Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Project Structure

- **lib/**:
  - **main.dart**: Entry point of the application.
  - **home_screen.dart**: Home screen of the app.
  - **quiz_screen.dart**: Quiz functionality with state management.
  - **data/posts.dart**: Data models or services.

- **test/**: Contains all testing files.
  - **unit/**: Unit tests for individual components.
  - **widget/**: Widget tests for UI components.

- **integration_test/**: Contains integration tests that interact with the complete app.

## Running the App

To run the app in debug mode:

```bash
flutter run
```

Ensure that you have a simulator/emulator running or a physical device connected.

## Testing

This project includes various types of tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of the application.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual components or classes.

- **Location**: `test/unit/`
- **Example Test**: `home_screen_test.dart`

**Run Unit Tests:**

```bash
flutter test test/unit/
```

### Widget Tests

Widget tests verify the UI components in isolation.

- **Location**: `test/widget/`
- **Example Test**: `quiz_screen_test.dart`

**Run Widget Tests:**

```bash
flutter test test/widget/
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests ensure that different parts of the app work together as expected.

- **Location**: `integration_test/`

**Run Integration Tests:**

```bash
flutter test integration_test/
```


Ensure that an emulator or physical device is connected before running integration tests.
